Instructions for running the simulation can be found in the `ControlPanel...maxpat` file

####Future Work:
- 3rd outlet of externals only outputs when there is a change in flock size -> is this possible?
- Attraction level based on attractors, not the boids
- Find interesting boid behavior
- Continue documentation of parameters / code
- Visually connect boids in same neighborhood (output a matrix from external with each boid and its neighbors) This will make neighborhoods / clusters more visually obvious -> output matrix with endpoints of line and flock ID (In progress)
