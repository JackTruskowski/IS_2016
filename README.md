####Final Writeups:
1. Overview of System - JACK
   - Overall architecture
   - Data structures
   - Design choices + things that didn't work and why
   
   
2. Documentation - JACK AND GRACE
   - LOTS
	 - Exs: functions that assume a certain range of parameters, cases
       that a function doesn't handle


3. User's Manual - GRACE
   - What are features; what can user control/change
   - Enough to allow someone who doesn't doesn't know the code to
     compile and run it
