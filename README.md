Instructions for running the simulation can be found in the `ControlPanel...maxpat` file

####Future Work:
- Visually connect boids in same neighborhood (output a matrix from external with each boid and its neighbors) This will make neighborhoods / clusters more visually obvious   
- Fix visual jump (Improve efficiency in message passing / handling of FlockIDs?)  
- Movable / Multiple Attractors  
- Implement the deletion of boids (age?)  
- Revisit the statistics used to characterize flock behavior  
- Stipulate where boids are born in space when they are added
